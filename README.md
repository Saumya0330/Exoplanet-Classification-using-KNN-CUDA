# Exoplanet-Classification-using-KNN-CUDA
This project successfully implements a custom K-Nearest Neighbors classifier for exoplanet identification from NASA's Kepler mission data, leveraging the power of parallel programming. 
This was a team effort and it would not have been possible without the help from my team mate @prakharraj11.
We believe The Universe is a pretty big place and if it's just us, it seems like an awful waste of space. In the words of Carl Sagan himself "Somewhere Something incredible is waiting to be known" and being in a field like this, we are on it!
